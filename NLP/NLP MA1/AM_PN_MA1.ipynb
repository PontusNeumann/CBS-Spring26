    "**Sentences 1, 3, and 4** share prepositional-phrase attachment ambiguity. The prepositional phrase “with + noun phrase” can attach to two different heads in the syntax: it can attach to the verb phrase, where it describes how the action is performed (typically an instrument/means reading), or it can attach to the noun phrase, where it describes which noun is being referred to (a modifier reading). In this setting, an ambiguous sentence is one where both attachments are grammatically possible, so the sentence allows two distinct interpretations even if one is less realistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentence 2** also has attachment ambiguity, but it is a temporal PP attachment ambiguity. The time phrase “on Saturday” can attach either to the higher verb “decided” (the deciding happened on Saturday) or to the embedded verb “leave” (the leaving happens on Saturday). In this case, the sentence is ambiguous because the time PP has two structurally valid attachment sites, leading to two different meanings."
