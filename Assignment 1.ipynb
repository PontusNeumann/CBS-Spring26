This aggregation improves interpretability, reduces dimensionality, and ensures that the covariance structure captures meaningful sector-level relationships rather than noise from very small individual sources. The sector-level aggregation reflects structured combinations of underlying sources and activities.

This approach ensures full transparency of the statistical calculations and demonstrates a clear understanding of the underlying theoretical foundations from Lecture 02.\n",

    "\n",
    "For a variable ( x ) with ( n ) observations:\n",
